# Streak Schemas (Conceptual)

## What is a Streak?
Consecutive days of meaningful creative action (posting published, challenge completed). It measures momentum, not volume.

## Mercy Mechanics
- Partial decay: breaking reduces length by a step, not to zero.
- Grace days: protection windows allow recovery without break.
- Protection can be consumed once per window.

## Resets vs Degrades
- Resets: only after protection and partial decay are exhausted.
- Degrades: missed day with protection available → consume protection; missed day without protection → partial decay.

## Relationship to Posting & Scheduling
- Only posted content (not scheduled) advances streaks.
- Scheduled posts count when they become posted.
- Failed posts do not break streaks.

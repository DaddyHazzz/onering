# Scoring Dimensions
- Clarity: is the message understandable and focused?
- Emotional Resonance: does it evoke feeling aligned to archetype?
- Platform Fit: does it match platform norms (length, tone)?
- Authenticity: does it sound like the user’s archetype and values?
- Momentum Alignment: does it push the narrative forward today?

Effects
- Scores adjust confidence and coach prompts.
- High authenticity and momentum alignment boost trust; low scores trigger guidance, not penalties.

# OneRing Product Vision

"OneRing is a mirror that shows creators who they are becoming."

## Rule of Magnetic Apps
Magnetic apps earn daily attention by compounding identity, status, and progress. They pull you back not with novelty, but with the promise of becoming someone you value. Every interaction contributes to a larger narrative of growth. The product must:
- Invite a small, meaningful action today
- Reflect who you are and who you’re becoming
- Reward consistency more than intensity
- Turn feedback into energy, not pressure

## Momentum Over Likes
Likes are a shallow proxy for value and often deliver short-lived dopamine. Momentum, by contrast, tracks the unfolding of creative identity over time: the cadence of output, quality improvements, audience resonance, and personal alignment.
- Momentum measures streaks, challenge completion, archetype alignment, and content lineage
- The system prioritizes durable habits over isolated wins
- The goal is sustained creative progress, not a single viral moment

## A Daily Ritual, Not a Utility
OneRing is a place to show up, not a tool you occasionally use. Ritual creates meaning and identity:
- Daily prompts and challenges are lightweight, focused, and achievable
- Feedback is supportive and forward-looking (coach, not judge)
- Visuals emphasize progress, rings, and compounding—never punitive metrics
- Mercy mechanics (partial resets, streak protection) keep momentum alive

## Why Open OneRing Today?
Because today’s action advances your story. OneRing answers: "What matters right now?" and turns that into a small step tied to your identity and goals. The payoff is cumulative—status, clarity, and momentum accrue with each day.

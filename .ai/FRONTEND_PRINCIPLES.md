# Frontend Experience Principles

## Momentum Beats Raw Metrics
Design for habit and identity, not vanity. Show compounding progress and alignment over time.

## Visual Feedback (Rings, Progress, Decay)
- Rings and arcs represent growth and cadence.
- Decay visuals signal natural drop-off without shaming.
- Micro-feedback celebrates small wins.

## Mercy Mechanics
- Streak protection windows.
- Partial resets instead of hard breaks.
- Recovery prompts after inactivity.

## AI Feedback Feel (Coach, Not Judge)
- Supportive, honest, and grounded.
- Small, actionable nudges only.
- No punitive phrasing; encourage next step.

## Never Punitive or Spammy
- No guilt-driven notifications.
- No dark patterns.
- Respect user attention and autonomy.

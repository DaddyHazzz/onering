# Challenges UI States
- Empty: No assignment yet; teaser for today’s challenge.
- Active: Challenge assigned; clear CTA and due time.
- Broken (missed): Soft decay, offer recovery or alternative.

Never show a red zero. Progress should decay softly, not collapse. Feedback should invite action today.

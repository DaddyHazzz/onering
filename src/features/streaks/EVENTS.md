# Streaks UI Events
- On streak.incremented: animate ring fill, show gentle congrats.
- On streak.missed: show protection/mercy options, no shame.
- On post.posted: reflect same-day increment once.

Never show a red zero. Progress should decay softly, not collapse. Feedback should invite action today.
